# Web Based Data Visualisation — or how you'll learn to love making websites with Plotly and D3

## Why?

### Power!

Sooo ... why would you make things hard for yourself?  When you can python away or hack in Matlab or RStudio, why would we turn our data visualisation problem into a "learning to make a web page" problem?  Geek masochism?  Perhaps.  The real answer though is far more impressive.  Power!  Like ... magical force lightening power.

### There is a disturbance ...

An important reason for adding these skills to your toolset, though, is that two forces are acting on and transforming research.  And taming them demainds a power like this.

**The first force is data**.  **Big data**.  Whether you come from a research domain that does not traditionally deal with data – hello Humanities ;\) – or a hardcore data driven science, chances are that your research is dealing with more data that's more complex than did your immediate predecessor.  Even more extreme is that some of you may even be moving beyond classical hypothesis driven research into "Big Data Science", where the size and scope of the dataset means that finding patterns and correlations in it, without prior hypotheses, is its own success.  Either way, the more data you have, the greater the challenge to understand and make sense of it.

Our first and finest weapon against incomprehensible masses of data is also the oldest — visualisation.  As visual mammals we have evolved to dedicate a large part of our brain to analysing visual information.  The power of data visualisation lies in its ability to harness this.  Two dimensional line and scatter plots are science's bread and butter.  But, with bigger, better and more complex data, our visualisations must also follow suit.

**The second force is the importance of having a web presence.**  Over the past decade the trend is clearly that researchers with a greater presence and exposure on the web get cited more.  Beyond this, openness in research, in the way of open access to publications and researchers making their data openly available, are becoming more desirable and important.  More cynically, we can question to what degree our colleagues actually read our wonderful yet hard-wrought publications.  And we probably know the answer.  And we probably know the why, too.  The pedantry and detail of academic literature, though important and rigorous, hinders understanding and communication.

The era has already arrived in which publications now have accompanying web pages with interactive data visualisations, video abstracts and helpful summaries and data and code files for colleagues.  Taking your research beyond the pay-wall of the dense and pedantic journal system, out into the lush, wide and open web, is now the best way to communicate and share your research.

## Power ... at what cost?

... **Not a lot actually.**

Websites, under the hood, are surprisingly simple.  They are made of only two things.

1. A simple text document,  that's kind of like a clunky MS Word document.
2. Some programming on top to make it dynamic.

The rest is done by the web browser which makes out of these ingredients the web pages we all know and love.

The clunky file is straight forward to make.  Kind of like `<title> I think this is a title <end title>`.  And the programming?  It is just like anything you would do in Python, R or Matlab.  In fact, the programming involved is often relatively straight forward compared to the sorts of things you would need to do with Python etc, in part because there are powerful libraries that do a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

_In short, if you've programmed anything before, you already know everything you need to know.  What you do need are some new tools, some new concepts, and this chapter to get you started._

## How much power then?

**... a lot actually.**

You can make dynamic, animated and interactive visualisations of what ever you can draw.  You can make data exploration apps.  That vividly tell the story of your research.  That anyone in world can use so long as they have a web browser \(which is basically everyone\), without having to install or update anything.  And, that are shareable, to everyone, merely through a URL, link or tweet.

For example ...  Viewers of your page can use buttons, menus or sliders to explore and delve deeper into your data.  Exploring on their own, they can understand it the way they need to.  They can ask their own questions of it, and, if you've allowed them to look at your data in the appropriate way, answer it for themselves.  They can also animate it and see how it evolves.  This frees you from the two dimensional constraint of paper \(or screen\) if your data has multiple dimensions or aspects to it.  With sliders you can move through a three dimensional data set and allow a two dimensional visualisation to animate with the user's positioning.  Or multiple two dimensional visualisations can be linked together, where the viewer can highlight certain portions of the data and see their representation in the various plots and across various dimensions.  Or, if you want to, you can go full 3D and make interactive 3D visualisations.

_In short, with universality and ubiquity, you can tell your story, of your research or otherwise, in a vivid and animated way that invites the viewer to explore your story so that they can understand it for themselves and thereby truly understand and appreciate it._
