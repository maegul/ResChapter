# Web Based Data Visualisation --- or how you'll learn to love making websites

## Why?

### Power!

Sooo ... why would you make things hard for yourself?  When you can python away or hack in Matlab or RStudio, why would we turn our data visualisation problem into a "learning to make a web page" problem?  Geek masochism?  Perhaps.  The real answer though is far more impressive.  Power!  Like ... magical force lightening power.

### There is a disturbance ...

An important reason for adding these skills to your toolset, though, is that two forces are acting on and transforming research.  And taming them demainds a power like this.

The first force is data.  Big data.  Whether you come from a research domain that traditionally doesn't deal with data – hello Humanities ;\) – or a hardcore data driven science, chances are that your research is dealing with more data than your immediate predecessor's work.  Even more extreme is that some of you may even be moving beyond classical hypothesis driven research into "Big Data Science" where the

## Power ... at what cost?

... **Not a lot actually.**

Websites, under the hood, are surprisingly simple.  They are made of only two things.

1. A simple text document,  that's kind of like a clunky MS Word document.  
2. Some programming on top to make it dynamic.  

The rest is done by the web browser which makes out of these ingredients the web pages we all know and love.

The clunky file is straight forward to make.  Kind of like `<title> I think this is a title <end title>`.  And the programming?  It is just like anything you would do in Python, R or Matlab.  In fact, the programming involved is often relatively straight forward compared to the sorts of things you would need to do with Python etc.

_In short, if you've programmed anything before, you already know everything you need to know.  What you do need are some new tools, some new concepts, and this chapter to get you started._

## How much power then?

**... a lot actually.**

You can make dynamic, animated and interactive visualisations of what ever you can draw.  You can make data exploration apps.  That vividly tell the story of your research.  That anyone in world can use so long as they have a web browser \(which is basically everyone\), without having to install or update anything.  And that are shareable merely through a URL, link or tweet.

For example ...  Viewers of your page can use buttons, menus or sliders to explore and delve deeper into your data.  Exploring on their own, they can understand it the way they need to.  They can ask their own questions of it, and, if you've allowed them to look at your data in the appropriate way, answer it for themselves.  They can also animate it and see how it evolves.  This frees you from the two dimensional constraint of paper \(or screen\) if your data has multiple dimensions or aspects to it.  With sliders you can move through a three dimensional data set and allow a two dimensional visualisation to animate with the user's positioning.  Or multiple two dimensional visualisations can be linked together, where the viewer can highlight certain portions of the data and see their representation in the various plots and across various dimensions.  Or, if you want to, you can go full 3D and make interactive 3D visualisations.

_In short, with universality and ubiquity, you can tell your story, of your research or otherwise, in a vivid and animated way that invites the viewer to explore your story so that they can understand it for themselves and thereby truly understand and appreciate it._
