# Web Based Data Visualisation --- or how you'll learn to love making websites

## Why?

Sooo ... why would you make things hard for yourself?  When you can python away or hack away in Matlab or RStudio, why would we turn our data visualisation problem into a "learning to make a web page" problem?  Geek masochism?  Perhaps.  The real answer though is far more impressive ... power!  Like ... force lightening power.

## Power ... at what cost?

... **Not a lot actually.**

Websites, under the hood, are surprisingly simple.  They are made of only two things.

1. A simple text document,  that's kind of like a clunky MS Word document.  
2. Some programming on top to make it dynamic.  

The rest is done by the web browser which makes out of these ingredients the web pages we all know and love.

The clunky file is straight forward to make.  Kind of like `<title> I think this is a title <end title>`.  And the programming?  It is just like anything you would do in Python, R or Matlab.  In fact, the programming involved is often relatively straight forward compared to the sorts of things you would need to do with Python etc.

In short, if you've programmed anything before, you already know everything you need to know.  What you do need are some new tools, some new concepts, and this chapter to get you started.

## How much power then?

**... a lot actually.**

You can make dynamic, animated and interactive visualisations of what ever you can draw.  You can make data exploration apps.  That vividly tell the story of your research.  That anyone can use so long as they have a web browser \(which is basically everyone\).  And that are shareable merely through a URL, link or tweet.

For example ...  Viewers of your page can use buttons, menus or sliders to explore and delve deeper into your data.  Exploring on their own, they can understand it the way they need to.  They can ask their own questions of it, and, if you've allowed them to look at your data in the appropriate way, answer it for themselves.  They can also animate it and see how it evolves.  This frees you from the two dimensional constraint of paper \(or screen\) if your data has multiple dimensions or aspects to it.  With sliders you can move through a three dimensional data set and allow a two dimensional visualisation to animate with the user's position of the slider.  Or multiple two dimensional visualisations can be linked together, where the viewer can highlight certain portions of the data and see their representation in the various plots.

## What's involved

### HTML

This is the easy stuff.  It's not real programming.  With this you set up your text and pictures and titles and fonts and colours.  I like to think of it as lego.

### Javascript

This is the magic.  Javascript is the programming language for websites.  It is much like python/Matlab/R.  But, it is built to create the interactivity we want from a webpage.

### Github Pages

Github is used for a number of things.  For us, they provide a very straightforward way to put our website online without us having to worry for a second about servers or anything like that.
