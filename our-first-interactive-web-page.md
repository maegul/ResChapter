* Challenge exercise
* Add to first page a button that adds and takes away the fundamentals \(use normal JS or the plotly API for buttons?\)

# Animation and Interaction

## Objectives

You made a web page, with a plot in it, that is interactive.  But you can go further.  As promised in the Introduction, one of the key advantages of making web pages is that you can easily build data exploration applications.  An interface that lets one easily move through different parts or aspects of their data in the search for patterns.  That's what we're going to do here.  We're going to animate the transition from data set to another.

1. Add a button which triggers a change in the data visualisation.
2. Make that change an animated change in the data.

## Add a Button ... back to the HTML

To add a button we use, can you guess, the HTML button element.  The text between the tags will be the text in the visual button on the page.  Add it to you HTML, preferably before the `<div id='my_plot'>` element.

```HTML
<button>Let's Dance</button>
```
