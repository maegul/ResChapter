## Let's get set up

### **Text Editor**

#### Sublime Text

A highly recommended text editor for making web pages is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) \(either 2 or the newer version 3\).  It is a nice and popular text editor for any programming you may want to do, but for web pages, it has some basic features like auto completion and HTML and Javascript syntax awareness built in that will help you.

They provide an unending free trial of the complete editor.  If you wish, you can pay for the product, without any feature improvements other than the warmness of your heart.

#### Atom

An editor with some features made specially for making web pages is [Atom](https://atom.io).  \(Interestingly, it is also made with the web page making technology we're learning here\).  It is free and open source, and may be the future of web page text editors.  

#### Other

Otherwise, if you already have a text editor that you know and love, stick with that one, there are no special requirements at all.

### Folders

Each web page we make is best done in a separate folder.  So let's make a folder for all our web pages, and then in that folder a new one for every new web page we want to make.

### GitHub account

This isn't necessary right now, but if you like to set everything up before you get started, go to github.com and sign up with your email.
