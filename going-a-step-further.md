# Where to from Here

So, you've made your first web page.  What now.  Well, a web page just doesn't come out of no where.  It starts with a story or message that wants to be told and shared.  So, if you're just starting your research career, there may be some time before you have a story that you want to tell.

Otherwise, keep this new skill alive, make some small pages that show something simple.  Maybe try to challenge yourself to make something a bit complex, but is the sort of thing that may well suit your research area and the kinds of pages you will want to make in the future.

Try to engage with the community.  Data visualisation is now a profession, along with data science and web page development and design.  You may be new to the game, but chances are you have interesting stories to tell.

Once you have your story though treat the web page for it as you would a publication or a thesis.  Chances are it won't be a quick all nighter, but with a bit of time and patience, you will make something wonderful and powerful.



## Plotly

Plotly is a powerful data visualisation tool.  Here are some features worth looking into:

* The ease with which various standard plots can be made \(see `https://plot.ly/javascript/#basic-charts`\).
* The ability to make interactive 3D plots with similar ease \(see `https://plot.ly/javascript/#3d-charts`\).
* The ability to use animate, which we've seen already, along with other built in functions to create interactive interfaces that allow the exploration of data \(see `https://plot.ly/javascript/#chart-events`\).

Plotly is also incredibly versatile.

* You can use plotly within your standard Python, R or Matlab workflow with specially designed implementations \(or APIs\) in each of those languages. \(see `https://plot.ly/api/`\), which can then easily generate the necessary javascript automatically should you wish to translate your work to a web page.
* Plotly provides a free cloud service for storing your plots for ease of sharing.
* Plotly also provides a free and easy to use web based editor for plotting, that also exports the relevant code in what every lagnuage you use \(javascript as well as Python, R, Matlab\).

## D3

D3 is the engine underneath Plotly.  If you want fine grain control of your data visualisation to do something that is unique that requires specific customisation, then D3 is the tool you need.  See `https://d3js.org`.

## HTML and CSS

There are plenty of little tips and tricks in using HTML and CSS.  See as a general reference `http://www.w3schools.com`.  And, if you want to delve deeper into the detail, see `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/`.

A very useful tool for laying out your pages is FlexBox.  It's lots of fun.  See for a cheat sheet: `https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/`
