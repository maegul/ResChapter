# Where to from Here

## Plotly

Plotly is a powerful data visualisation tool.  Here are some features worth looking into:

* The ease with which various standard plots can be made \(see `https://plot.ly/javascript/#basic-charts`\).
* The ability to make interactive 3D plots with similar ease \(see `https://plot.ly/javascript/#3d-charts`\).
* The ability to use animate, which we've seen already, along with other built in functions to create interactive interfaces that allow the exploration of data \(see `https://plot.ly/javascript/#chart-events`\).

Plotly is also incredibly versatile.

* You can use plotly within your standard Python, R or Matlab workflow with specially designed implementations \(or APIs\) in each of those languages. \(see `https://plot.ly/api/`\), which can then easily generate the necessary javascript automatically should you wish to translate your work to a web page.
* Plotly provides a free cloud service for storing your plots for ease of sharing.
* Plotly also provides a free and easy to use web based editor for plotting, that also exports the relevant code in what every lagnuage you use \(javascript as well as Python, R, Matlab\).

## D3

D3 is the engine underneath Plotly.  If you want fine grain control of your data visualisation to do something that is unique that requires specific customisation, then D3 is the tool you need.  See `https://d3js.org`.



## HTML and CSS

There are plenty of little tips and tricks in using HTML and CSS.  See as a general reference `http://www.w3schools.com`.  And, if you want to delve deeper into the detail, see `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/`.
