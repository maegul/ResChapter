## What's involved

### HTML

This is the easy stuff.  It's not real programming.  With this you set up your text and pictures and titles and fonts and colours.  I like to think of it as lego.  You have different blocks of different shapes and colours, and you simply pile them up on top of each other as you see fit.

### Javascript

This is the magic.  Javascript is the programming language for websites.  It is much like python/Matlab/R.  But, it is built to create the interactivity we want from a webpage.  If you've programmed before, there's nothing really new to learn here \(apart from some minor differences between javascript and the other languages\).

### Github Pages

Github is something you've probably heard of before.  It is used for a number of things.  For us, they provide a very straightforward way to put our website online without us having to worry for a second about servers or anything like that.
