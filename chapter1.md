# What's involved?

## HTML

This is the easy stuff.  It's not actually programming.  With this you set up your text and pictures and titles and fonts and colours.  I like to think of it as lego.  You have different blocks of different shapes and colours, and you simply pile them up on top of each other as you see fit.  There's only some mechanical stuff to learn, and there isn't anything that isn't a single google search away.

## Javascript

This is the magic.  Javascript is the programming language for websites.  It is much like python/Matlab/R.  But, it is built to create the interactivity we want from a webpage.  If you've programmed before, there's nothing really new to learn here \(apart from some minor differences between javascript and the other languages\).  What will be new, though, is the idea of using javascript to make a web page dynamic and interactive.

## Github Pages

Github is something you've probably heard of before.  It is used for a number of things.  For us, it provides a very straightforward way to put our website online without us having to worry for a second about servers or anything like that.
